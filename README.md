# Platform Ocean

Platform Ocean is a customisable social media meta-platform intended to better support groups in their efforts to self-organise.

The platform may be freely instantiated and modified with server-side plug-ins to tailor the platform's functionality to best suit requirements.

The design and development of the Platform Ocean meta-platform was the Final Year MEng Project of Edward Scaife at Imperial College London.
