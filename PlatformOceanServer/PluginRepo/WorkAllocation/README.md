# Work Allocation

This plug-in manages the assigning and completing of work.

The list of sample jobs in `config.json` determines how jobs are defined as well as what user properties are generated by this plug-in

## Commands

- `wa.joblist`: Sends any updates to the joblist to all users.
- `wa.take <index>`: Assigns job in joblist indexed by <index> to the sending user.
- `wa.addjob <description>`: creates a new job with description <description> and appends to end of joblist.
- `wa.complete <index>`: IFF job indexed by <index> is assigned to the sending user, marks this job complete, removes it from the list and increments the users 'jobsCompleted' property by 1.
